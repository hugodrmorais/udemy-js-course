# JavaScript Mastery Course Practice

This repository serves as a practical workspace for all the code I'm writing while taking the Udemy course "JavaScript Completo - Do Iniciante ao Mestre."

**My Goals for this Course:**

* Solidify core JavaScript concepts (variables, data types, operators, control flow).
* Master functions, objects, and arrays.
* Understand DOM manipulation and asynchronous JavaScript.
* Build practical projects to apply learned knowledge.
* Improve problem-solving skills with JavaScript.

Feel free to explore the different sections and files as I progress through the course!
